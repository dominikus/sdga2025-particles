	"intro_2": "A child in Pakistan who starts school at age 4 can expect to complete only 4.8 years of actual learning over the course of their education. Pakistan also has some of the highest numbers of out-of-school children (OOSC) in the world, especially among girls who constitute 54 percent of OOSC. One of the biggest challenges Pakistan faces is that the countryâ€™s education spending fails to yield results regarding quality and access. In 2020, it spent 2.3 percent of GDP on education, notably below the South Asian regional average of 2.9 percent and the global average of 4.3 percent. In addition, human and financial resources are not directed where they are most needed to improve quality and access to education.",
